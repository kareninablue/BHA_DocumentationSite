Karenina van den Crommenacker, bio artist and visual researcher, is intrigued by all that the nonhuman world has to offer. She transcends anthropocentric perspectives by highlighting the ingenuity of other organisms and ecosystems.

Karenina translates these inspiring phenomena into well-designed and appealing multimedia works. By making the invisible visible, she challenges you to experience the world from a new perspective.
