What is nature and what do we mean by that word?
Are we seperating ourselfs from the other if we define nature as non human? 
Do we need to include ourselfs in the term nature?

Is nonhuman a good term to use? Or does it have negetive connotations? If inhuman is barbaric and cruel.

How can I BioHack in a ecocentric manner? 

Are their other organisms that are doing GMO? 

What is interaction?
How can I design a interaction between humans and non humans?
